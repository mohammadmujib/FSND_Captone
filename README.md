# Full Stack Casting Agency API Backend

## Casting Agency Specifications

The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process. 

## Motivation for project

This is the capstone project of Udacity fullstack nanodegree program, which demonstrate the skillset of
using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Auth0, gunicorn and heroku to develop and deploy a RESTful API. 

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### Setting up the database

To run the tests on the api, you must add atleast 3 movies and 3 actors in the database.

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Running the server

From within the file directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## Tasks

### Setup Auth0

1. Create a new Auth0 Account
2. Select a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new, single page web application
4. Create a new API
    - in API Settings:
        - Enable RBAC
        - Enable Add Permissions in the Access Token
5. Create new API permissions:
    - `add:actors`
    - `add:movies`
    - `delete:actors`
    - `delete:movies`
    - `edit:actors`
    - `edit:movies`
    - `view:actors`
    - `view:movies`
6. Create new roles for:
    - Casting Assistant
        - Can view actors and movies`
    - Casting Director
        - All permissions a Casting Assistant has and ...
        - Add or delete an actor from the database 
        - Modify actors or movies
    - Executive Producer
        - All permissions a Casting Director has and ...
        - Add or delete a movie from the database
7. Test your endpoints with [Postman](https://getpostman.com). 
    - Register 3 users - assign the Casting Assistant role to one    and Casting Director role to another, and Executive Producer   to the other.
    - Sign into each account and make note of the JWT.
    - Test each endpoint and correct any errors.
